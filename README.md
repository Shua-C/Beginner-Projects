# Assignment-6
This repository hold 2 simple projects that were designed to incorporate concepts that were covered in my classes.

  I am very early on in my studies of computer science which is shown in the projects, I have taken a enty level course that covered fundamental coding concepts
  while learning Python. I am currently in a programming course that focuses on learning and applying fundamental concepts but this time while learning C++.
  The Rock Paper Sciccors game gave us a opportunity to actually apply concepts that were taught in up until that point and produce something (as the basic level)
  that was usuable. The emphasis here was to solidify the use of functions especially in ther relation with other functions. The C++ poject was used in order to emphasis the 
  use of formatting and displaying output in creative ways. This project was used as an reinforcement of manipulating width and spacing of information.
